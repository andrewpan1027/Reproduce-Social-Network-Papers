# Reproduce-Social-Network-Papers
A collection of notebooks with reproduced results of some social-network-related papers.

I am interested in social network and focus on the user behavior patterns of online social network. I find and read some classic and latest papers related with my research purpose. BUT READING IS CHEAP! 

The main purpose of these notebooks is to push myself to figure out the details and methods in papers, and more importantly, a good research habit. For every paper I will try my best to reproduce the result (mainly Figures). These notebooks are organized as:

- **title** and **author_year**
